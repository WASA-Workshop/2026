# Welcome to WASA 2026
With the advent of software and electronics, automotive and mobility companies enable innovation to improve safety, security, driver experience, and driving autonomy. Moreover, the complexity and size of software continue to grow with innovations, such as self-learning algorithms and advanced driving and mobility features, which all lead to the ultimate goal of autonomously driving vehicles. Consequently, the increasing use of software introduced a paradigm shift by requiring automotive and mobility companies to develop their systems using architecture and model-based techniques. Although model-based techniques, e.g. MATLAB/Simulink and Stateflow, are being accepted in the automotive industry as standard languages and tools for developing automotive control software, system and software architecture techniques are still far from being widely accepted. This excludes the AUTOSAR standard, which defines the language for designing and configuring automotive software architectures and identifies major architectural components of automotive systems. 

This workshop addresses issues related to autonomous systems and their software architecture and engineering techniques, relevant for the industry of autonomous systems. Therefore, to bring together researchers and practitioners in autonomous systems and software architecture and engineering, WASA is being organised with the [International Conference on Software Architecture (ICSA)](https://conf.researchr.org/home/icsa-2026), the premier international software architecture conference. Our goal is that the workshop will identify new research directions, roadmaps, challenges, and establish long-term collaborations between participants from both academia and industry, even after the workshop.

## Call for Papers
The program committee of the 12th WASA edition seeks submissions of original and unpublished high-quality papers describing fundamental and applied research, new methods, approaches, and processes, novel applications, approaches for education and training in automotive system/software architecture, and experience reports on all topics related to software architecture including, but not limited to:

- Autonomous systems and software architectures:
  - architecture description languages
  - hardware/software co-design
  - design patterns
  - communication infrastructure
  - centralized/zonal architectures
  - influence of AI technologies on architecture
  - influence of security requirements due to over-the-air updates or car-2-X communication on the architecture
  - service-oriented architectures
- Automotive, robotics, and mobility (e.g., drones) software & systems engineering:
  - software quality, safety, security
  - model-based design, component-based design
  - CI/CD, agile processes, software ecosystems
  - hybrid & fully electric vehicles
  - cooperative and automated driving
  - data analytics
  - systems engineering
- Assessment, Verification & Validation:
  - safety assurance and assessment
  - verification & validation techniques
  - challenges and solutions for AI-based services
  - compliance management of standards or regulations

### Types of Submissions

- **Full papers** (max. 8 pages in IEEE Computer Science proceedings format) presenting novel research ideas, significant empirical studies, successful industrial applications, or important perspectives.
- **Industrial papers** (max. 6 pages in IEEE Computer Science proceedings format) sharing industrial experience, challenges, research or technical problems, case studies.
- **Position or future trend papers** (max. 4 pages in IEEE Computer Science proceedings format) raising new ideas, challenges, ongoing research or early research results, and future trends.

Submissions must follow the [IEEE Computer Science proceedings format](https://www.ieee.org/conferences/publishing/templates.html), as workshop proceedings will be published in ICSA 2026 Companion proceedings, and appear in IEEE Xplore Digital Library.

Papers need to be submitted electronically via [EasyChair](https://easychair.org/my2/conference?conf=icsa2026) by selecting the WASA track.
